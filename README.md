## User Guide
1. Download the ipynb file (Newest version on Mar. 22, 2025: pending-submission-four)
2. Upload it to Google Colab
3. Download the data zip from Kaggle and upload it to Google Drive (under MyDrive)
4. Go to this link and download this code locally, then upload same code to Google colab: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ym_x3cKsYC2PhdwhtcOHqvNaKzdKIr_v?usp=sharing
5. Run these code blocks in order: first code block, code block 3-22 (ignore weird debugging output, its kinda out of order sorry), run the code block after this line (!zip -r model_backup.zip, ctrl f to find it)

Explanation for code: basically it includes an initial training and the first stage of fine-tuning for the model above but now I want to do a second stage of fine-tuning, which is why you would run the code block after this line (!zip -r model_backup.zip, ctrl f to find it). You need to upload the files in my Google Drive folder link above because it contains the model history for the initial training and first stage fine-tuning so that you don't have to rerun it again yourself. please let the groupchat know if you have any questions, thank you!
